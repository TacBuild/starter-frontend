### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
- A TON wallet (Tonkeeper or TON Space recommended)

### Installation

```

git clone https://github.com/tacbuild/starter-frontend.git my-tac-app
cd my-tac-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Configuration

This starter is pre-configured to work with example contracts deployed on the TAC testnet. The contract addresses are defined in lib/constants.ts:

```tsx
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = {
  SIMPLE_MESSAGE: "0x474a33F40232bdF188D46E016ad36F517Be91Bc3",
  MESSAGE_PROXY: "0x63b9E4DAc2615104DfE0d72AC593285114aeF8cc",
  CROSS_CHAIN_LAYER: "0xAd2fBeB7CE5f6e4F9C21090C7e4018081f4b323d",
} as const;
```

If you've deployed your own contracts, update these addresses accordingly.
